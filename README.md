**About**

Greetings! I'm Wondmagegn Chosha, a full-stack web developer with a flair for building impactful applications. My forte lies in Webpack, JavaScript, and Flask, and I've also dabbled in Unity game development.

My career started in application development, where I worked on e-learning platforms and honed my DevOps skills. Since then, I've explored desktop and mobile app development, with a focus on document verification and forgery detection.

Recently, I completed a rigorous software engineering program, which catapulted my coding skills to a professional level. Currently, I'm a student at a cutting-edge full-stack web development school that specializes in remote team collaboration.

As a passionate developer, I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to innovate. With my expertise in game development and web development, I'm eager to create innovative applications that make a difference in the world. Let's build something great together!
